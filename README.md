Exploratory Data Analysis on Paris 2024 Olympics Medals Dataset

I conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Paris 2024 Olympics Medals dataset, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains detailed information on the medals won by various countries during the 2024 Summer Olympics, spanning multiple sports and events.

The goal of this EDA was to uncover key insights into the distribution of medals across nations, analyze the performance of countries in different sports, and identify trends and patterns in medal achievements. Key aspects of the analysis included:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensuring data integrity by handling missing values, normalizing data formats, and correcting inconsistencies.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to understand overall trends in medal distribution.
Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to illustrate the medal counts by country, sport, and gender.
Country Performance Analysis: Comparing the performance of top-ranking nations and analyzing which countries excelled in specific sports.
Trend Identification: Identifying patterns in how certain regions or countries performed compared to historical data and detecting standout athletes or teams.
The EDA provided valuable insights into the dynamics of the Paris 2024 Olympics and helped set the foundation for more advanced analyses like predictive modeling and hypothesis testing.
